To make new features work, you need to extract the csv file called music_taste from the src.
Then whole original code is going to work with no error.
This new feature requires users to write any genre they want to listen and get music recommendation aboit it(R&B/Soul,Rock,Pop,Hip-Hop,Electronic,Jazz,Country,Classical)
To make code work you need to uncomment the "//Music_helper musBot = new Music_helper("music_taste.csv");" and "//musBot" in the MyFirstBot.java class
